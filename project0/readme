This project is a 2048 game. By completing this project, I got familiar with Java and the various tools used in the course like the IntelliJ IDE and JUnit for writing and running unit tests. 

I spend about 10 hours on this project. I read the spec, discovered the starter code, and iterated several times to write and improve my code.It felt overwhelming at first, but I am so happy that I can persist to the end.
